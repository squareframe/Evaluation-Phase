Here we are working on below conditions on the same Topics

1) Now make only 1 data frame of two CSV files using the join operation of pandas and start doing EDA.

2) Do the complete EDA in detail to explore the insights of data and write detailed observations of each analysis.



Phase 4

1) Write the complete Machine learning code to make predictions of votes and gross collection. Use appropriate models on their label basis. Remember you need to make 2 different predictions: vote and gross collection.

2) Apply all the best techniques of scaling, and hyperparameter tuning, and avoid underfitting or overfitting (bias/variance)

3) At the end save the best model and convey on which basis you have chosen that model.
